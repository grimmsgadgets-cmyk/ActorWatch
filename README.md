# Actor Tracker

A lightweight threat actor lookup tool that turns reporting into a clear starting point for defensive review.

## What it does

Enter an actor name to see:
- Who they are (quick context)
- What changed recently (recent reporting summary)
- What to check first (a short list of practical checks)

## Run locally (Docker)

```bash
docker compose up --build
