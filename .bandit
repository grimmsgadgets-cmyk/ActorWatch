# B608 (hardcoded_sql_expressions) fires on any f-string used in a DB call,
# including the safe pattern of building a parameterized IN-clause placeholder
# list via ','.join('?' for _ in ids).  All occurrences were manually audited
# on 2026-03-01 and confirmed to contain only '?,?,?' placeholders or
# compile-time constant table/column names — never user-controlled data.
# The actual SQL values are always passed through parameterized query tuples.
